- mortgage → real_estate, economy_monetary
- other loans → finance, economy_fiscal

**Investments:**
- crypto investments → blockchain
- stock/etf investments → earnings, ipo, mergers_and_acquisitions, financial_markets, technology

**User Statement Keywords:**
Look for these keywords in the user statement and map them:
- crypto/bitcoin/ethereum → blockchain
- stock/invest → financial_markets
- retire/retirement → economy_macro
- mortgage/house/home → real_estate
- loan/debt → finance
- save/saving → economy_monetary

## Output Format:
Return your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
```json
{
  "relevant_categories": ["category1", "category2", "category3", ...]
}
```

## Prioritization Rules:
1. Always include "economy_macro" as a baseline category
2. Prioritize categories based on the user's most prominent financial activities:
   - Student loans and mortgages (highest priority if present)
   - Investment and crypto accounts  
   - Credit cards and other loans
   - Bank accounts (lowest priority)
3. Categories mentioned in the user statement should be highly prioritized
4. Remove duplicates and order by relevance

## Example:
Input:
```json
{
  "accounts": [{"type": "investment"}, {"type": "crypto"}],
  "loans": [{"type": "student_loan"}],
  "investments": [{"type": "stock"}, {"type": "crypto"}]
}
```
User statement: "I want to pay off my student loans and invest in tech stocks"

Output:
```json
{
  "relevant_categories": [
    "economy_fiscal",
    "finance", 
    "blockchain",
    "earnings",
    "financial_markets",
    "technology",
    "ipo",
    "mergers_and_acquisitions",
    "economy_macro"
  ]
}
```

Now analyze the provided user financial data and statement to generate the most relevant news categories.
